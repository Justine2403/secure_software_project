# Secure Software Project
This repository regroups all the project I did during my exchange program at NCU in Secure Software.

## Project 1: Force brute password
*Description:* Given only usernames known to public, the goal is to launch a brute force dictionary attack using the text file to find out their password.

## Project 2: Access rights and access control
*Description:* In this project, we need to develop a system where the login is required using "username" and "password". Each user serves a different role in the system. The goal is to implement access control of four roles (root, admin, developer and customer)

## Project 3: Acceptance tests for specified black box
*Description:* This project asks to write a function that repeatedly sums a number until a single digit is obtained. If we have "1234" in input, then we will have "1" (1+2+3+4=10, 1+0=1) in output.

## Project 4:
*Description:* In this project, we want to create a network fuzzer, which is a program that will try out many different URL variants to see if any exist on a web server.
